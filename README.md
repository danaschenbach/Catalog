How to make use of this: This program uses both front end & back end technologies, as well as
third party API for login purposes.

2nd: download all files in project folder
3rd: open Gitbash & cd to downloaded folder
4th: run command vagrant up
5th: run command python populatecatalog.py this will give a starter catalog database
6th: run command python application.py
7th: open browser and goto http://localhost:5000 which will take you to the homepage

All this was made possible with intellectual funding by; Udacity forum, Google, stackoverflow.com,
friends and people like you(sorry been watching PBS...lol)
